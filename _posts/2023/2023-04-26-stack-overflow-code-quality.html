  Understanding Stack Overflow code quality: a recommendation of caution.

    Community Question and Answer (CQA) platforms use the power of online groups to solve problems, or gain information. While these websites host useful information, it is critical that the details provided on these platforms are of high quality, and that users can trust the information. This is particularly necessary for software development, given the ubiquitous use of software across all sections of contemporary society. Stack Overflow is the leading CQA platform for programmers, with a community comprising over 10 million contributors. While research confirms the popularity of Stack Overflow, concerns have been raised about the quality of answers that are provided to questions on Stack Overflow. Code snippets often contained in these answers have been investigated; however, the quality of these artefacts remains unclear. This could be problematic for the software engineering community, as evidence has shown that Stack Overflow snippets are frequently used in both open source and commercial software. This research fills this gap by evaluating the quality of code snippets on Stack Overflow. We explored various aspects of code snippet quality, including reliability and conformance to programming rules, readability, performance and security. Outcomes show variation in the quality of Stack Overflow code snippets for the different dimensions; however, overall, quality issues in Stack Overflow snippets were not always severe. Vigilance is encouraged for those reusing Stack Overflow code snippets.
