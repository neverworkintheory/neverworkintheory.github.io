    <blockquote> BACKGROUND: Software libraries provide a set of reusable functionality, which helps developers write code in a systematic and
    timely manner. However, selecting the appropriate library to use is
    often not a trivial task. AIMS: In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of software metrics in helping developers choose libraries.
    Different developers care about different aspects of a library and
    two developers looking for a library in a given domain may not
    necessarily choose the same library. Thus, instead of directly recommending a library to use, we provide developers with a metric-based
    comparison of libraries in the same domain to empower them with
    the information they need to make an informed decision. METHOD:
    We use software data analytics from several sources of information to create quantifiable metric-based comparisons of software
    libraries. For evaluation, we select 34 open-source Java libraries
    from 10 popular domains and extract nine metrics related to these
    libraries. We then conduct a survey of 61 developers to evaluate
    whether our proposed metric-based comparison is useful, and to
    understand which metrics developers care about. RESULTS: Our
    results show that developers find that the proposed technique provides useful information when selecting libraries. We observe that
    developers care the most about metrics related to the popularity, security, and performance of libraries. We also find that the usefulness
    of some metrics may vary according to the domain. CONCLUSIONS:
    Our survey results showed that our proposed technique is useful.
    We are currently building a public website for metric-based library
    comparisons, while incorporating the feedback we obtained from
    our survey participants. </blockquote> 
    
    Software libraries are a life saver when it comes to writing codes quickly and efficiently. But selecting 
    the best-suited software library for a particular program can be very tricky. To help developers choose 
    the right one, [delaMora2018] proposed a metric-based comparison of software libraries
    and evaluated its usefulness. 
    
    The authors began by first implementing a tool that calculates the following metrics of software libraries 
    in a particular domain:
        • Popularity
        • Release Frequency
        • Issue Response Time and Issue Closing Time
        • Backward Compatibility
        • Performance and Security
        • Last Modification Date
        • Last discussed on Stack Overflow 
    
    The calculation was done by mining multiple sources of data like version control systems, issue tracking 
    systems, and Q&A websites. The authors then applied the tool on 34 open-source Java libraries from 10 
    popular domains and asked 61 developers from various backgrounds to evaluate its usefulness. Their
    feedbacks were also collected to understand which metrics mattered the most.
    
    The authors discovered that when selecting the most appropriate library from a particular domain, 
    developers found metric-based comparison of libraries very useful. Moreover, when comparing 
    software libraries, metrics related to Performance, Popularity and Security were considered the most 
    helpful. Developers had also expressed the need for additional metrics related to usability, 
    documentation, functionality, community support and licensing.
