    Educators often form opinions on which programming mistakes novices make
    most often–for example, in Java: "they always confuse equality with
    assignment", or "they always call methods with the wrong types".  These
    opinions are generally based solely on personal experience.  We report a
    study to determine if programming educators form a consensus about which
    Java programming mistakes are the most common.  We used the Blackbox data
    set to check whether the educators' opinions matched data from over 100,000
    students–and checked whether this agreement was mediated by educators'
    experience.  We found that educators formed only a weak consensus about
    which mistakes are most frequent, that their rankings bore only a moderate
    correspondence to the students in the Blackbox data, and that educators'
    experience had no effect on this level of agreement.  These results raise
    questions about claims educators make regarding which errors students are
    most likely to commit.

  So, what's the most common kind of error novice Java programmers
  make?  Turns out it isn't confusing assignment "=" with equality
  "==", but rather mis-matched or unbalanced parentheses.  Invoking
  methods with the wrong argument (e.g., <code>list.get("abc")</code>)
  is the second most common, and control flow being able to reach the
  end of a non-void method without returning a value is third.  And
  which errors take the most time to fix?  The answer to that turns
  out to be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Confusing short-circuit logical operators like <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>
    with their non-short-circuiting bitwise equivalents <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using <code>==</code> instead of <code>.equals</code> to compare strings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ignoring the return value from a non-void method.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As if this data wasn't enough, the authors also compared this data
  to a survey of what teachers believe about student errors (see Brown
  and Altadmri,
  "<a href="http://www.twistedsquare.com/Educators.pdf">Investigating
  Novice Programming Mistakes: Educator Beliefs vs Student Data</a>",
  ICER'14, http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2632320.2632343).  Their main
  finding: "…educators formed only a weak consensus about which
  mistakes are most frequent, that their rankings bore only a moderate
  correspondence to the students in the Blackbox data, and that
  educators' experience had no effect on this level of agreement."  It
  may be years before textbooks begin to reflect these insights, and
  decades before they start to influence language design, but at least
  we now know that better is possible.
