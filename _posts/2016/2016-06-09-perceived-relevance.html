    The number of software engineering research papers over the last
    few years has grown significantly. An important question here is:
    how relevant is software engineering research to practitioners in
    the field? To address this question, we conducted a survey at
    Microsoft where we invited 3,000 industry practitioners to rate
    the relevance of research ideas contained in 571 ICSE, ESEC/FSE
    and FSE papers that were published over a five year period.  We
    received 17,913 ratings by 512 practitioners who labelled ideas as
    essential, worthwhile, unimportant, or unwise.  The results from
    the survey suggest that practitioners are positive towards studies
    done by the software engineering research community: 71% of all
    ratings were essential or worthwhile. We found no correlation
    between the citation counts and the relevance scores of the
    papers. Through a qualitative analysis of free text responses, we
    identify several reasons why practitioners considered certain
    research ideas to be unwise.  The survey approach described in
    this paper is lightweight: on average, a participant spent only
    22.5 minutes to respond to the survey. At the same time, the
    results can provide useful insight to conference organizers,
    authors, and participating practitioners.

  There's lots in this paper, but its most important finding (for me)
  is buried in the middle of the abstract: "no correlation between
  citation counts and [practitioner-assigned] relevance scores".  In
  plainer language, academic researchers and practitioners care about
  different things (which may mean this blog doesn't have much of a
  future).
</p>
<p>
  So what <em>do</em> the two groups care about?
  The top studies favored by practitioners were:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new technique that not only detects leaks, but also points
    developers to the locations where the underlying errors may be
    fixed.
  </li>
  <li>
    A technique to engineer applications with a self-healing layer for
    service-oriented systems that dynamically reveals and fixes
    interoperability problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    A technique to monitor if a system fulfils its requirements
    expressed as probabilistic properties (e.g., performance,
    reliability, safety, and availability requirements) at runtime.
  </li>
  <li>
    Automatically detecting security vulnerabilities in client-side
    self-contained components that interact with one another.
  </li>
  <li>
    Failure to release unneeded system resources results in resource
    leaks, which can lead to performance degradation and system
    crashes. The paper presents a new tool that performs static
    analysis to find code that causes resource leaks in Java programs.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  while academics' favorites were:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Empirical study on whether the bug fixes recorded in these
    historical datasets is a fair representation of the full
    population of bug fixes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Technique to verify the correctness of a family of programs in a
    software product line against a set of properties.
  </li>
  <li>
    Empirical study of using software defect data from one project to
    predict defects in another project.
  </li>
  <li>
    A graph model based on Markov chains, which captures bug tossing
    history, to better assign developers to bug reports
  </li>
  <li>
    Over 30 years ago, the preprocessor cpp was developed to extend
    the programming language C by lightweight metaprogramming
    capabilities. The paper describes a study that analyzes 40 C
    projects to investigate how cpp preprocessor is employed to
    implement variability.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As the authors say several times, this is a preliminary study,
  and is based on feedback from developers at only one company (albeit
  a large one).  I hope they do another, larger, study, but I hope
  even more that a decade from now, there will be at
  least <em>some</em> correlation between what the
  <a href="http://third-bit.com/2012/12/06/two-solitudes-illustrated.html">"two
  solitudes" of software engineering</a> care about.
