    Sometimes software engineering research is like studying supernovas:
    repeatability isn't feasible (at least, not given current technology),
    so you have to study the ones you can find.
    Other times, though,
    researchers <em>can</em> do controlled experiments and replicate the experiments of others.
    <cite>Kosar2018</cite> is an example of that:
    in it,
    the authors replicate an experiment reported in <cite>Kosar2011</cite>
    with several improvements to remove some threats to validity.
    Their conclusion:
    developers are signfiicantly better at tool-based program comprehension when using a DSL
    than when using a general-purpose language.

    This is an important result,
    though the adjective "tool-based" does qualify it a bit.
    <cite>Kosar2018</cite> required developers to use an IDE while trying to complete tasks
    rather than (for example) reading printouts;
    on the other hand,
    their subjects were new to the DSL being used,
    so if anything the results <em>underestimate</em> the possible performance improvement.
    There is still lots of room for further analysis—I'd like to see someone look at well-designed versus poorly-designed DSLs,
    for example,
    because there are certainly lots of the latter—and
    we can still argue about how scalable DSLs are in the absence of customized debuggers,
    but at this point,
    I think the onus is on people who argue that DSLs <em>don't</em> make life better
    to prove their case.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Domain-specific languages (DSLs) allow developers to write code at a higher
  level of abstraction compared with general-purpose languages
  (GPLs). Developers often use DSLs to reduce the complexity of GPLs. Our
  previous study found that developers performed program comprehension tasks
  more accurately and efficiently with DSLs than with corresponding APIs in
  GPLs. This study replicates our previous study to validate and extend the
  results when developers use IDEs to perform program comprehension tasks. We
  performed a dependent replication of a family of experiments. We made two
  specific changes to the original study: (1) participants used IDEs to perform
  the program comprehension tasks, to address a threat to validity in the
  original experiment and (2) each participant performed program comprehension
  tasks on either DSLs or GPLs, not both as in the original experiment. The
  results of the replication are consistent with and expanded the results of the
  original study. Developers are significantly more effective and efficient in
  tool-based program comprehension when using a DSL than when using a
  corresponding API in a GPL. The results indicate that, where a DSL is
  available, developers will perform program comprehension better using the DSL
  than when using the corresponding API in a GPL.
