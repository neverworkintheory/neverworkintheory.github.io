  <em>
    It is nearly 50 years since Dijkstra argued that goto obscures the
    flow of control in program execution and urged programmers to
    abandon the goto statement. While past research has shown that
    goto is still in use, little is known about whether goto is used
    in the unrestricted manner that Dijkstra feared, and if it is
    'harmful' enough to be a part of a post-release bug. We,
    therefore, conduct a two part empirical study - (1) qualitatively
    analyze a statistically representative sample of 384 files from a
    population of almost 250K C programming language files collected
    from over 11K GitHub repositories and find that developers use
    goto in C files for error handling (80.21±5%) and cleaning up
    resources at the end of a procedure (40.36±5%); and (2)
    quantitatively analyze the commit history from the release
    branches of six OSS projects and find that no goto statement was
    removed/modified in the post-release phase of four of the six
    projects. We conclude that developers limit themselves to using
    goto appropriately in most cases, and not in an unrestricted
    manner like Dijkstra feared, thus suggesting that goto does not
    appear to be harmful in practice.

  This abstract shows just how far software engineering has progressed
  in the last fifty years.  Where one of founders of the field could
  only express a (strong) opinion, today's researchers can gather data,
  analyze, and settle the question empirically.

  But saying "how far software engineering has progressed" is
  misleading.  What this paper and others presented on this blog
  actually show is how far the leading edge of empirical software
  engineering research has come.  Most practitioners are still arguing
  from first principles and personal experience, just as Dijkstra did.
  But where he can be forgiven&mdash;the data needed to settle the
  issue either didn't exist or wasn't available in 1968&mdash;the only
  excuses today's practitioners have are that they aren't exposed to
  this kind of work as undergraduates, and can't read much of it after
  graduation because it's locked away behind paywalls.  I'm grateful
  that this study's authors chose not to do the second; now, how are
  we going to fix the first?
