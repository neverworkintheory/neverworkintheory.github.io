    Developers often struggle to navigate an Open Source Software (OSS) project’s issue-tracking system and find a suitable task. Proper issue labeling can aid task selection, but current tools are limited to classifying the issues according to their type (e.g., bug, question, good first issue, feature, etc.). In contrast, this paper presents a tool (GiveMeLabeledIssues) that mines project repositories and labels issues based on the skills required to solve them. We leverage the domain of the APIs involved in the solution (e.g., User Interface (UI), Test, Databases (DB), etc.) as a proxy for the required skills. GiveMeLabeledIssues facilitates matching developers’ skills to tasks, reducing the burden on project maintainers. The tool obtained a precision of 83.9\% when predicting the API domains involved in the issues. The replication package contains instructions on executing the tool and including new projects.
