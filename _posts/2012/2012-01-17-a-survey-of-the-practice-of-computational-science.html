    Computing plays an indispensable role in scientific
    research. Presently, researchers in science have different
    problems, needs, and beliefs about computation than professional
    programmers. In order to accelerate the progress of science,
    computer scientists must understand these problems, needs, and
    beliefs. To this end, this paper presents a survey of scientists
    from diverse disciplines, practicing computational science at a
    doctoral-granting university with very high research activity. The
    survey covers many things, among them, prevalent programming
    practices within this scientific community, the importance of
    computational power in different fields, use of tools to enhance
    performance and software productivity, computational resources
    leveraged, and prevalence of parallel computation. The results
    reveal several patterns that suggest interesting avenues to bridge
    the gap between scientific researchers and programming tools
    developers.

    Several studies of scientific programmers and scientific
    programming have come out in the past few years
    [<a href="#1">1</a>]. This in-depth analysis, which is based on
    semi-structured interviews with 114 researchers in science and
    engineering at Princeton University, is probably the most
    insightful to date. It explores the languages and tools
    researchers use, their debugging techniques, the environments they
    use, their performance tuning strategies, their use of parallelism
    [<a href="#2">2</a>], and many other aspects of their work. While
    some of its conclusions are unsurprising (e.g., the fact that
    scientists don't test their programs rigorously), others highlight
    fruitful directions for future research—most particularly,
    the need to integrate performance analysis and tuning tools into
    everyday programming. More studies like this in other areas would
    be very welcome.

    sequential program many times with slightly different parameters)
    is by far the most common.
