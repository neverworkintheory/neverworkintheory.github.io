  <p>
    Have you ever developed any software without the help of Stack
    Overflow? In just 13 years, Stack Overflow has become an essential
    platform to get programming help. It has also become a source of
    data for researchers to solve many software engineering problems.
    However, <cite>Tang2021</cite> are the first to evaluate whether
    Stack Overflow comments and edits can help solve the software
    maintenance problems. Their main goal was to find out how useful
    Stack Overflow comment-edit pairs are in making tools for code
    maintenance tasks like program repair and code recommender
    systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors used SOTorrent to automatically mine edits of code
    blocks in answers and marked the comment that invoked the
    edit. The answers were selected from five popular tags---Java,
    JavaScript, PHP, Python and Android---and the edit-invoker comment
    was selected based on three conditions:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      the comment has been made before the edit;
    </li>
    <li>
      the comment contains a code term that has been added to or
      removed from a code snippet in the edit; and
    </li>
    <li>
      the editor and the commenter are different users.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The authorsevaluated the effectiveness of their automated process
    by comparing it to a manual analysis, and gave priority to finding
    more actual pairs of comment-edit, rather than having all possible
    pairs in the dataset.  They also explored comment-edit pairs for
    tangled change, which they defined as a single edit that changes
    code to resolve multiple issues raised in multiple comments.
    Tangled changes reduce the usability of the comment-edit pairs as
    the comment for which a part of the edit occurred becomes
    untraceable.  Their overall findings were:
    <ul>
      <li>
	The automated comment-edit mapping algorithm performs
	considerably well (78% precision).
      </li>
      <li>
	Edits in the comment-edit pairs are rarely tangled (11% are
	tangled).
      </li>
      <li>
	Nine of the comment categories identified by a previous study
	are applicable for edit-invoking comments; the most common of
	these is fixing an error.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, only 27% of comment-edit pairs are useful because
    many edits add new code blocks or the comments are contextual. (To
    evaluate usefulness, the authors manually changed the code of 15
    GitHub repositories and submitted pull requests, of which 10 were
    accepted.)

  Code maintenance data sets typically consist of a before version of
  the code and an after version that contains the improvement or
  fix. Such data sets are important for various software engineering
  support tools related to code maintenance, such as program repair,
  code recommender systems, or Application Programming Interface (API)
  misuse detection. Most of the current data sets are typically
  constructed from mining commit history in versioncontrol systems or
  issues in issue-tracking systems. In this paper, we investigate
  whether Stack Overflow can be used as an additional source for
  building code maintenance data sets. Comments on Stack Overflow
  provide an effective way for developers to point out problems with
  existing answers, alternative solutions, or pitfalls. Given its
  crowd-sourced nature, answers are then updated to incorporate these
  suggestions. In this paper, we mine commentedit pairs from Stack
  Overflow and investigate their potential usefulness for constructing
  the above data sets. These comment-edit pairs have the added benefit
  of having concrete descriptions/explanations of why the change is
  needed as well as potentially having less tangled changes to deal
  with. We first design a technique to extract related comment-edit
  pairs and then qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the
  nature of these pairs. We find that the majority of comment-edit
  pairs are not tangled, but find that only 27% of the studied pairs
  are potentially useful for the above applications. We categorize the
  types of mined pairs and find that the highest ratio of useful pairs
  come from those categorized as Correction, Obsolete, Flaw, and
  Extension. These categories can provide data for both corrective and
  preventative maintenance activities. To demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our extracted pairs, we submitted 15 pull requests
  to popular GitHub repositories, 10 of which have been accepted to
  widely used repositories such as Apache Beam
  (https://beam.apache.org/) and NLTK (https://www.nltk.org/). Our
  work is the first to investigate Stack Overflow commentedit pairs
  and opens the door for future work in this direction. Based on our
  findings and observations, we provide concrete suggestions on how to
  potentially identify a larger set of useful comment-edit pairs,
  which can also be facilitated by our shared data.
