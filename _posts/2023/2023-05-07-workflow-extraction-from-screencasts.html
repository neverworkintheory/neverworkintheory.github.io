<blockquote>
  <p>
    Programming screencasts (e.g., video tutorials on Youtube or live coding stream on Twitch)
    are important knowledge source for developers to learn programming knowledge,
    especially the workflow of completing a programming task.
    Nonetheless,
    the image nature of programming screencasts limits the accessibility of screencast content and the workflow embedded in it,
    resulting in a gap to access and interact with the content and workflow in programming screencasts.
    Existing non-intrusive methods are limited to extract either primitive human-computer interaction (HCI) actions
    or coarse-grained video this http URL this work,
    we leverage Computer Vision (CV) techniques to build a programming screencast analysis tool
    which can automatically extract code-line editing steps (enter text, delete text, edit text and select text) from screencasts.
    Given a programming screencast,
    our approach outputs a sequence of coding steps and code snippets involved in each step,
    which we refer to as programming workflow.
    The proposed method is evaluated on 41 hours of tutorial videos and live coding screencasts with diverse programming environments.
    The results demonstrate our tool can extract code-line editing steps accurately
    and the extracted workflow steps can be intuitively understood by developers.
