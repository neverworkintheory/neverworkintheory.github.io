<p>
  It's 2023,
  and open-access preprints are still available for less than half of the papers being presented at
  <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/program/icse-2023/program-icse-2023/">the world's largest software engineering research conference</a>.
  Putting it another way,
  more than half of the people presenting at the conference don't care if practitioners like me know what they're doing.
  To paraphrase <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/110346004575670585">Mike Hoye</a>,
  paywalled research papers are the academic equivalent of NFTs.
