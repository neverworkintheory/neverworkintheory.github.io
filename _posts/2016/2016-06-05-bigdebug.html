  <em>
    <p>
      Developers use cloud computing platforms to process a large
      quantity of data in parallel when developing big data analytics.
      Debugging the massive parallel computations that run in today's
      data-centers is time consuming and error-prone.  To address this
      challenge, we design a set of interactive, real-time debugging
      primitives for big data processing in Apache Spark, the next
      generation data-intensive scalable cloud computing
      platform. This requires rethinking the notion of step-through
      debugging in a traditional debugger such as gdb, because pausing
      the entire computation across distributed worker nodes causes
      significant delay and naively inspecting millions of records
      using a watchpoint is too time consuming for an end user.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, BIGDEBUG's simulated breakpoints and on-demand
      watchpoints allow users to selectively examine distributed,
      intermediate data on the cloud with little overhead.  Second, a
      user can also pinpoint a crash-inducing record and selectively
      resume relevant sub-computations after a quick fix.  Third, a
      user can determine the root causes of errors (or delays) at the
      level of individual records through a fine-grained data
      provenance capability.  Our evaluation shows that BIGDEBUG
      scales to terabytes and its record-level tracing incurs less
      than 25% overhead on average.  It determines crash culprits
      orders of magnitude more accurately and provides up to 100% time
      saving compared to the baseline replay debugger. The results
      show that BIGDEBUG supports debugging at interactive speeds with
      minimal performance impact.

  I stumbled across the journal <em>Software: Practice &amp;
  Experience</em> in the summer of 1985, while I was working at Bell
  Northern Research in Ottawa.  It was a revelation: here, at last,
  were the in-depth discussions of the design of real tools that I had
  always known had to be out there somewhere, but had never been able
  to find.  The journal isn't nearly what it used to be, but this
  paper would have fit right in during its heyday.  Its authors
  describe a pragmatic solution to a real-world problem, one that
  actually grapples with the issues practitioners face every day.
  Like
  <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">the
  original paper on MapReduce</a>, it should be required reading both
  in its own right and as an example of how to think when building
  tools.
