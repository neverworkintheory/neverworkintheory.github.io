  Everybody wants things to get better.
  People who are serious about it draw up budgets,
  because that forces them to be explicit about exactly what they're going to do
  and what's needed to make it happen.
</p>

<p>
  I'm sure it's clear by now that we'd like more programmers to know
  what software engineering researchers have learned over the past fifty years
  and how to act on it.
  We have a plan to make that happen:
  replace the team programming project course that most students do
  in the third or fourth year of an undergraduate degree in computer science
  with one in which they work in teams to design an experiment,
  collect data,
  analyze it,
  and figure out what (if anything) they've proven.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    It's a minimally disruptive adjustment to the curriculum,
    so other faculty won't object on administrative grounds.
  </li>
  <li>
    it gives CS students a chance to learn some practical data science,
    (which most of them will enjoy,
    and which will make them more employable.
  </li>
  <li>
    It helps prepare them for graduate school
    (so it's in professors' own interests as well).
  </li>
  <li>
    And crucially,
    they will be more likely to understand and value researchers' experimental findings
    if they have done an experiment of their own.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  What we need to make this happen is a textbookâ€”more specifically,
  two dozen lectures' worth of material as both prose and slides
  with a bunch of examples, exercises, and grading rubrics,
  so that busy professors don't have to build this course from scratch.
  Figuring a week of full-time work per lecture because most of this material would be genuinely new,
  then doubling that estimate based on past experience,
  it would take one person-year to build this course,
  run it for the first time,
  fix what didn't work,
  and package it up for general use.
</p>

<p>
  Putting it another way,
  if two dozen professors in software engineering wanted this to happen
  and could each contribute US$6500 to fund two weeks' worth of this work,
  our entire discipline would have what it needs to shape the young minds of today
  so that they would be more engaged with our work tomorrow.
  If you're at ICSE'23 in Melbourne right now,
  please have a chat with your colleagues about this.
  If we all give a little, we can all get a lot.
