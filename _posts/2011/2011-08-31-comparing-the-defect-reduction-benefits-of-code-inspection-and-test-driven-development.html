    This study is a quasi-experiment comparing the software defect
    rates and implementation costs of two methods of software defect
    reduction: code inspection and test-driven development. We divided
    participants, consisting of junior and senior computer science
    students at a large Southwestern university, into four groups
    using a two-by-two, between-subjects, factorial design and asked
    them to complete the same programming assignment using either
    test-driven development, code inspection, both, or neither. We
    compared resulting defect counts and implementation costs across
    groups. We found that code inspection is more effective than
    test-driven development at reducing defects, but that code
    inspection is also more expensive. We also found that test-driven
    development was no more effective at reducing defects than
    traditional programming methods.

    I'm still not sure what to think about test-driven development. On
    the one hand, I feel that it helps me program better—and feel that
    strongly enough that I teach TDD in courses. On the other hand,
    studies like this one, and the other summarized in Erdogmus et
    al's chapter
    in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321"><cite>Making
    Software</cite></a>, seem to show that the benefits are
    illusory. That might mean that we're measuring the wrong thing,
    but I'm still waiting for one of TDD's advocates to say how we'd
    measure the right thing.

    One thing I <em>am</em> sure of is the importance of studying
    students. It's easy to dismiss the results of such studies by
    saying that they don't necessarily apply to experienced full-time
    programmers in industry, but that's missing the point. They
    definitely <em>do</em> apply to students, and if a tool or
    practice isn't compelling to a 20-year-old who is exposed to it
    for three weeks, it's going to spread slowly (if at all).
