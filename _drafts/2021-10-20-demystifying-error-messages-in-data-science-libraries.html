  Error messages are critical starting points for
  debugging. Unfortunately, they seem to be notoriously cryptic,
  confusing, and uninformative. Yet, it still remains a mystery why
  error messages receive such bad reputations, especially given that
  they are merely very short pieces of natural language text. In this
  paper, we empirically demystify the causes and fixes of ``bad''
  error messages, by qualitatively studying 201 Stack Overflow threads
  and 335 GitHub issues. We specifically focus on error messages
  encountered in data science development, which is an increasingly
  important but not well studied domain. We found that the causes of
  ``bad'' error messages are far more complicated than poor phrasing
  or flawed articulation of error message content. Many error messages
  are inherently and inevitably misleading or uninformative, since
  libraries do not know user intentions and cannot ``see'' external
  errors. Fixes to error-message-related issues mostly involve source
  code changes, while exclusive message content updates only take up a
  small portion. In addition, whether an error message is informative
  or helpful is not always clear-cut; even error messages that clearly
  pinpoint faults and resolutions can still cause confusion for
  certain users. These findings thus call for a more in-depth
  investigation on how error messages should be evaluated and improved
  in the future.
