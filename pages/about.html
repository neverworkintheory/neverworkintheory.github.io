  People have been building complex software for over sixty years, but until
  recently, only a handful of researchers had studied how it was actually
  done. Many people had opinions—often very strong ones—but most of these were
  based on personal anecdotes or the kind of "it's obvious" reasoning that led
  Aristotle to conclude that heavy objects fall faster than light ones.

  Over the last twenty-five years, a growing number of researchers have been
  looking to real life for both questions and answers. Unfortunately, most
  people in industry still don't know what researchers have found out, or even
  what kinds of questions they could answer. One reason is their belief that
  software engineering research is divorced from real-world problems (an
  impression that is reinforced by how irrelevant most popular software
  engineering textbooks seem to the undergraduates who are forced to wade
  through them).  Another is that many research results are hidden behind
  academic paywalls, which makes them inaccessible to practitioners who aren't
  willing to gamble $40 on the off-chance that a paper might contain something
  useful.

  The aim of this site is to be a bridge between researchers and
  practitioners. Each post highlights some useful results from studies past and
  present in the hope that this will encourage discussion of what we know, what
  we think we know that ain't actually so, why we believe some things but not
  others, and what questions should be tackled next.  In order to be reviewed, a
  paper must present the results of some kind of empirical study and be of
  potential interest to people building actual software systems.  If you would
  like to contribute a paper or a review, please
