    Defect prediction techniques could potentially help us to focus
    quality-assurance efforts on the most defect-prone files. Modern
    statistical tools make it very easy to quickly build and deploy
    prediction models. Software metrics are at the heart of prediction
    models; understanding how and especially why different types of
    metrics are effective is very important for successful model
    deployment. In this paper we analyze the applicability and
    efficacy of process and code metrics from several different
    perspectives. We build many prediction models across 85 releases
    of 12 large open source projects to address the performance,
    stability, portability and stasis of different sets of
    metrics. Our results suggest that code metrics, despite widespread
    use in the defect prediction literature, are generally less useful
    than process metrics for prediction. Second, we find that code
    metrics have high stasis; they don't change very much from release
    to release. This leads to stagnation in the prediction models,
    leading to the same files being repeatedly predicted as defective;
    unfortunately, these recurringly defective files turn out to be
    comparatively less defect-dense.

    Software engineering practices are often based on the 'guruisms'
    or pure myth. However, in recent years researchers have
    empirically prove or disprove some of these myths. One example is
    code cloning being considered as bad practice. But why?
    A <a href="{{'/2011/08/16/cloning-considered-harmful-considered-harmful.html' | relative_url}}">past
    review</a> of Kapser and Godfrey's work stated that many code
    clones are actually OK. Kapser and Godfrey found that as many as
    71% of the clones they studied could be considered to have a
    positive impact on the maintainability of the software
    system. This isn't the only clones result that denounces the "bad
    practice" premise: Rahman et al.'s
    "<a href="http://www.cabird.com/papers/rahman2010cws.pdf">Clones:
    What is that Smell</a>?" found no evidence that cloning makes code
    more defect prone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, Rahman et al. are exploring the question of "how" and "why"
    process metrics are better than code metrics. In this "don't take
    my word for it" study, the authors answer seven research questions
    comparing the performance, stability, portability and stasis of
    these metrics. To answer the "how" they found the following:
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>Process metrics create significantly better defect predictors than code metrics across multiple learners.</li>
  <li>By using older project releases to predict for newer ones, they found no significant difference in the stability of process metrics and code metrics.</li>
  <li>Process metrics are more portable than code metrics, in other words, using data from one project to predict for another works better with process metrics.</li>
  <li>Process metrics are less static than code metrics: They change more than code metrics over releases.</li>
</ol>
  <p>
    To answer the "why" they found that code metrics have what the
    authors call "high stasis": they don't change much over
    releases. This led them to conclude that "…the stasis of code
    metrics leads to stagnant prediction models, that predict the same
    files as defective over and over again".
  </p>
  <p>
    Is this a bad thing? Their results show that not only do code
    metrics predict for "recurringly" defective files, these files
    tend to be larger and less defect dense, thus making code metric
    based predictors less cost effective. Considering that the use of
    software metrics for defect prediction helps to prioritize quality
    assurance activities, this paper definitely helps in the decision
    process of which metrics to collect for software projects and why.
