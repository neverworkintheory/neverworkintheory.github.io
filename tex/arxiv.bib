Title = {Studying the Characteristics of SQL-related Development Tasks: An Empirical Study},
Year = {2023},
Eprint = {arXiv:2301.10315},
abstract = {A key function of a software system is its ability to facilitate the manipulation of data, which is often implemented using a flavour of the Structured Query Language (SQL). To develop the data operations of software (i.e, creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data), developers are required to excel in writing and combining both SQL and application code. The problem is that writing SQL code in itself is already challenging (e.g., SQL anti-patterns are commonplace) and combining SQL with application code (i.e., for SQL development tasks) is even more demanding. Meanwhile, we have little empirical understanding regarding the characteristics of SQL development tasks. Do SQL development tasks typically need more code changes? Do they typically have a longer time-to-completion? Answers to such questions would prepare the community for the potential challenges associated with such tasks. Our results obtained from 20 Apache projects reveal that SQL development tasks have a significantly longer time-to-completion than SQL-unrelated tasks and require significantly more code changes. Through our qualitative analyses, we observe that SQL development tasks require more spread out changes, effort in reviews and documentation. Our results also corroborate previous research highlighting the prevalence of SQL anti-patterns. The software engineering community should make provision for the peculiarities of SQL coding, in the delivery of safe and secure interactive software.}

Title = {Persona-based Assessment of Software Engineering Student Research Projects: An Experience Report},
Year = {2023},
Eprint = {arXiv:2302.05618},
abstract = {Students enrolled in software engineering degrees are generally required to undertake a research project in their final year through which they demonstrate the ability to conduct research, communicate outcomes, and build in-depth expertise in an area. Assessment in these projects typically involves evaluating the product of their research via a thesis or a similar artifact. However, this misses a range of other factors that go into producing successful software engineers and researchers. Incorporating aspects such as process, attitudes, project complexity, and supervision support into the assessment can provide a more holistic evaluation of the performance likely to better align with the intended learning outcomes. In this paper, we present on our experience of adopting an innovative assessment approach to enhance learning outcomes and research performance in our software engineering research projects. Our approach adopted a task-oriented approach to portfolio assessment that incorporates student personas, frequent formative feedback, delayed summative grading, and standards-aligned outcomes-based assessment. We report upon our continuous improvement journey in adapting tasks and criteria to address the challenges of assessing student research projects. Our lessons learnt demonstrate the value of personas to guide the development of holistic rubrics, giving meaning to grades and focusing staff and student attention on attitudes and skills rather than a product only.}

Despite this fact, no research has explored how software developers approach requesting gender disclosure from users. To understand how developers think about gender in software, we present an interview study with 15 software developers recruited from the freelancing platform Upwork as well as Twitter. We also collected and categorized 917 threads that contained keywords relevant to gender from programming-related sub-forums on the social media service Reddit. 16 posts that discussed approaches to gender disclosure were further analyzed. We found that while some developers have an understanding of inclusive gender options, programmers rarely consider when gender data is necessary or the way in which they request gender disclosure from users. Our findings have implications for programmers, software engineering educators, and the broader community concerned with inclusivity.}

Title = {Case studies of development of verified programs with Dafny for accessibility assessment},
Year = {2023},
Eprint = {arXiv:2301.03224},
abstract = {Formal verification techniques aim at formally proving the correctness of a computer program with respect to a formal specification, but the expertise and effort required for applying formal specification and verification techniques and scalability issues have limited their practical application. In recent years, the tremendous progress with SAT and SMT solvers enabled the construction of a new generation of tools that promise to make formal verification more accessible for software engineers, by automating most if not all of the verification process. The Dafny system is a prominent example of that trend. However, little evidence exists yet about its accessibility. To help fill this gap, we conducted a set of 10 case studies of developing verified implementations in Dafny of some real-world algorithms and data structures, to determine its accessibility for software engineers. We found that, on average, the amount of code written for specification and verification purposes is of the same order of magnitude as the traditional code written for implementation and testing purposes (ratio of 1.14)---an ``overhead'' that certainly pays off for high-integrity software. The performance of the Dafny verifier was impressive, with 2.4 proof obligations generated per line of code written, and 24 ms spent per proof obligation generated and verified, on average. However, we also found that the manual work needed in writing auxiliary verification code may be significant and difficult to predict and master. Hence, further automation and systematization of verification tasks are possible directions for future advances in the field.}

Year = {2023},
Eprint = {arXiv:2301.07524},
abstract = {There is abundant observational data in the software engineering domain, whereas running large-scale controlled experiments is often practically impossible. Thus, most empirical studies can only report statistical correlations---instead of potentially more insightful and robust causal relations. This paper discusses some novel techniques that support analyzing purely observational data for causal relations. Using fundamental causal models such as directed acyclic graphs, one can rigorously express, and partially validate, causal hypotheses; and then use the causal information to guide the construction of a statistical model that captures genuine causal relations---such that correlation does imply causation. We apply these ideas to analyzing public data about programmer performance in Code Jam, a large world-wide coding contest organized by Google every year. Specifically, we look at the impact of different programming languages on a participant's performance in the contest. While the overall effect associated with programming languages is weak compared to other variables---regardless of whether we consider correlational or causal links---we found considerable differences between a purely statistical and a causal analysis of the very same data. The takeaway message is that even an imperfect causal analysis of observational data can help answer the salient research questions more precisely and more robustly than with just purely statistical techniques.}

Past research has identified that bots that communicate too often can irritate developers, which affects the utility of the bot. However, it is not clear what other properties of human-bot collaboration affect developers' preferences, or what impact these properties might have. The main idea of this paper is to explore characteristics affecting developer preferences for interactions between humans and bots, in the context of GitHub pull requests. We carried out an exploratory sequential study with interviews and a subsequent vignette-based survey. We find developers generally prefer bots that are personable but show little autonomy, however, more experienced developers tend to prefer more autonomous bots. Based on this empirical evidence, we recommend bot developers increase configuration options for bots so that individual developers and projects can configure bots to best align with their own preferences and project cultures.}

Participants agreed on big picture motivations, such as learning new skills or improving the community. The main contradictions occurred inside activity systems on details of implementation or between system motives, instead of big picture motivations. Two most significant contradictions involved planning, and converging on design and technical approaches. These findings demonstrate the value of examining civic tech development processes as evolving activity systems.}

Through fifteen interviews with software and game development streamers, we investigate why people choose to stream themselves programming and if they perceive themselves improving their programming skills by live streaming. We found that the motivations to stream included accountability, self-education, community, and visibility of the streamers' work, and streamers perceived a positive influence on their ability to write source code.

To answer this and investigate the outcomes of impactful research, we performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 4 354 SE patents citing 1 690 SE papers published in four leading SE venues between 1975--2017.  Moreover, we conducted a survey on 475 authors of 593 top-cited and awarded publications, achieving 26\% response rate. Overall, researchers have equipped practitioners with various tools, processes, and methods, and improved many existing products. SE practice values knowledge-seeking research and is impacted by diverse cross-disciplinary SE areas. Practitioner-oriented publication venues appear more impactful than researcher-oriented ones, while industry-related tracks in conferences could enhance their impact. Some research works did not reach a wide footprint due to limited funding resources or unfavorable cost-benefit trade-off of the proposed solutions. The need for higher SE research funding could be corroborated through a dedicated empirical study. In general, the assessment of impact is subject to its definition. Therefore, academia and industry could jointly agree on a formal description to set a common ground for subsequent research on the topic.}

Year = {2023},
Eprint = {arXiv:2302.05536},
abstract = {Capstone courses in undergraduate software engineering are a critical final milestone for students. These courses allow students to create a software solution and demonstrate the knowledge they accumulated in their degrees. However, a typical capstone project team is small containing no more than 5 students and function independently from other teams. To better reflect real-world software development and meet industry demands, we introduce in this paper our novel capstone course. Each student was assigned to a large-scale, multi-team (i.e., company) of up to 20 students to collaboratively build software. Students placed in a company gained first-hand experiences with respect to multi-team coordination, integration, communication, agile, and teamwork to build a microservices based project. Furthermore, each company was required to implement plug-and-play so that their services would be compatible with another company, thereby sharing common APIs. Through developing the product in autonomous sub-teams, the students enhanced not only their technical abilities but also their soft skills such as communication and coordination. More importantly, experiencing the challenges that arose from the multi-team project trained students to realize the pitfalls and advantages of organizational culture. Among many lessons learned from this course experience, students learned the critical importance of building team trust. We provide detailed information about our course structure, lessons learned, and propose recommendations for other universities and programs. Our work concerns educators interested in launching similar capstone projects so that students in other institutions can reap the benefits of large-scale, multi-team development.}

In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of Glaze, a tool that enables artists to apply ``style cloaks'' to their art before sharing online. These cloaks apply barely perceptible perturbations to images, and when used as training data, mislead generative models that try to mimic a specific artist. In coordination with the professional artist community, we deploy user studies to more than 1000 artists, assessing their views of AI art, as well as the efficacy of our tool, its usability and tolerability of perturbations, and robustness across different scenarios and against adaptive countermeasures. Both surveyed artists and empirical CLIP-based scores show that even at low perturbation levels (p=0.05), Glaze is highly successful at disrupting mimicry under normal conditions (>92\%) and against adaptive countermeasures (>85\%).}

abstract = {Newcomers are critical for the success and continuity of open source software (OSS) projects. To attract newcomers and facilitate their onboarding, many OSS projects recommend tasks for newcomers, such as good first issues (GFIs). Previous studies have preliminarily investigated the effects of GFIs and techniques to identify suitable GFIs. However, it is still unclear whether just recommending tasks is enough and how significant mentoring is for newcomers. To better understand mentoring in OSS communities, we analyze the resolution process of 48,402 GFIs from 964 repositories through a mix-method approach. We investigate the extent, the mentorship structures, the discussed topics, and the relevance of expert involvement. We find that \~70\% of GFIs have expert participation, with each GFI usually having one expert who makes two comments. Half of GFIs will receive their first expert comment within 8.5 hours after a newcomer comment. Through analysis of the collaboration networks of newcomers and experts, we observe that community mentorship presents four types of structure: centralized mentoring, decentralized mentoring, collaborative mentoring, and distributed mentoring. As for discussed topics, we identify 14 newcomer challenges and 18 expert mentoring content. By fitting the generalized linear models, we find that expert involvement positively correlates with newcomers' successful contributions but negatively correlates with newcomers' retention. Our study manifests the status and significance of mentoring in the OSS projects, which provides rich practical implications for optimizing the mentoring process and helping newcomers contribute smoothly and successfully.}

We analyzed more than a million Java submissions and more than 1.3 million Python submissions, studied the most prevalent types of code quality issues and the dynamics of how students fix them. We provide several case studies of different issues, as well as an analysis of why certain issues remain unfixed even after several attempts. Also, we studied abnormally long sequences of submissions, in which students attempted to fix code quality issues after passing the task. Our results point the way towards the improvement of online courses, such as making sure that the task itself does not incentivize students to write code poorly.}

We conducted a survey of developers in software delivery teams (n=3,281) to test our model and analyzed the data using structural equation modeling, moderation, and multi-group analysis. Our results show that Organizational Culture, Climate for Learning, Sense of Belonging, and Inclusiveness are positively associated with Work Satisfaction, which in turn is associated with Reduced Burnout. Our model generated through a largescale survey can guide organizations in how to reduce workforce burnout by creating a climate for learning, inclusiveness in teams, and a generative organizational culture where new ideas are welcome, information is actively sought and bad news can be shared without fear.}

To that end, we develop a theoretical model that seeks to understand the link between OSS developer motives and a Sense of Virtual Community (SVC). We test the model with a dataset collected in the Linux Kernel developer community (N=225), using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results for this case study show that intrinsic motivations (social or hedonic motives) are positively associated with a sense of virtual community, but living in an authoritative country and being paid to contribute can reduce the sense of virtual community. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for open source projects to foster a sense of virtual community, with a view to retaining contributors and improving projects' sustainability.}

Several strategies we identified, such as (Deliberately) Not Trying to Look Younger, were not previously described in the software engineering literature. We found that, in some companies, older women developers are recognized as having particular value, further strengthening the known benefits of diversity in the workforce. Based on the experiences and strategies, we suggest organizations employing software developers to consider the benefits of hiring veteran women software developers. For example, companies can draw upon the life experiences of older women developers in order to better understand the needs of customers from a similar demographic. While we recognize that many of the strategies employed by our study participants are a response to systemic issues, we still consider that, in the shortterm, there is benefit in describing these strategies for developers who are experiencing such issues today.}

Eprint = {arXiv:2301.04563},
Howpublished = {TOSEM 2023},
abstract = {Complex software systems have a network of dependencies. Developers often configure package managers (e.g., npm) to automatically update dependencies with each publication of new releases containing bug fixes and new features. When a dependency release introduces backward-incompatible changes, commonly known as breaking changes, dependent packages may not build anymore. This may indirectly impact downstream packages, but the impact of breaking changes and how dependent packages recover from these breaking changes remain unclear. To close this gap, we investigated the manifestation of breaking changes in the npm ecosystem, focusing on cases where packages' builds are impacted by breaking changes from their dependencies. We measured the extent to which breaking changes affect dependent packages. Our analyses show that around 12\% of the dependent packages and 14\% of their releases were impacted by a breaking change during updates of non-major releases of their dependencies. We observed that, from all of the manifesting breaking changes, 44\% were introduced both in minor and patch releases, which in principle should be backward compatible. Clients recovered themselves from these breaking changes in half of the cases, most frequently by upgrading or downgrading the provider's version without changing the versioning configuration in the package manager. We expect that these results help developers understand the potential impact of such changes and recover from them.}

Past studies focused on specific ethical issues (e.g., gender bias and fairness in OSS). There is little to no study on the different types of unethical behavior in OSS projects. We present the first study of unethical behavior in OSS projects from the stakeholders' perspective. Our study of 316 GitHub issues provides a taxonomy of 15 types of unethical behavior guided by six ethical principles (e.g., autonomy). Examples of new unethical behavior include soft forking (copying a repository without forking) and self-promotion (promoting a repository without self-identifying as contributor to the repository). We also identify 18 types of software artifacts affected by the unethical behavior. The diverse types of unethical behavior identified in our study (1) call for attentions of developers and researchers when making contributions in GitHub, and (2) point to future research on automated detection of unethical behavior in OSS projects. Based on our study, we propose Etor, an approach that can automatically detect six types of unethical behavior by using ontological engineering and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules to model GitHub attributes and software artifacts. Our evaluation on 195,621 GitHub issues (1,765 GitHub repositories) shows that Etor can automatically detect 548 unethical behavior with 74.8\% average true positive rate.

Using this data, we explore the relations of the factors to each other and build mixed-effect logistic regression models to empirically explain pull request decision. Results: Our study shows that a small number of factors explain pull request decision with the integrator same or different from the submitter as the most important factor. We also noted that some factors are important only in special cases e.g., the percentage of failed builds is important for pull request decision when continuous integration is used.}
