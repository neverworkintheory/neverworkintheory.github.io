<p>
  You are invited to participate in a survey on software licensing
  designed to investigate how well software developers understand common
  open source software licenses. We are looking for software developers
  that have built or are currently building on open source software in
  their projects (and I am personally interested in hearing from people
  building open source software for research).  The study is being
  conducted by Prof. Gail Murphy (murphy@cs.ubc.ca) and graduate student
  Daniel Almeida (daa@cs.ubc.ca); participating in the anonymous online
  survey will take approximately 30 minutes. If you are interested in
  participating, please go to:
