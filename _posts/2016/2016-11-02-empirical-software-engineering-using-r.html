<p>
  Derek Jones has begun assembling a book to be titled
  <em>Empirical Software Engineering Using R</em>.
  You can <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">view the work so far</a>
  or <a href="https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-book">file issues in this GitHub repo</a>.
  I think this is a really exciting development,
  and I'm looking forward to seeing it evolve.
