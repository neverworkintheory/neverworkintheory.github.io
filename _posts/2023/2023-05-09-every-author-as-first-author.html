<p>Erik D. Demaine and Martin L. Demaine.
Every author as first author.
2023.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    We propose a new standard for writing author names on papers and in bibliographies,
    which places every author as a first authorâ€”superimposed.
    This approach enables authors to write papers as true equals,
    without any advantage given to whoever's name happens to come first alphabetically (for example).
    We develop the technology for implementing this standard in LaTeX, BibTeX, and HTML;
    show several examples;
    and discuss further advantages.
