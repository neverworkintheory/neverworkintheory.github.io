    <a href="{{'/2012/10/25/an-experiment-about-static-and-dynamic-type-systems.html' | relative_url}}">Way back in 2012</a>
    we reviewed <cite>Hanenberg2010</cite>,
    which found that (under very specific and carefully explained circumstances)
    the use of static typing did <em>not</em> make programmers more productive
    than the use of dynamic typing.
    However,
    in a later paper (<cite>Hanenberg2013</cite>),
    researchers looked at, "…whether static type systems improve the maintainability of software
    systems, in terms of understanding undocumented code, fixing type errors,
    and fixing semantic errors" and found that,
    "…static types are indeed beneficial to these activities, except when
    fixing semantic errors." Digging deeper, they found that, "…developers using a dynamic type system tend to
    look at different files more frequently when doing programming tasks—which
    is a potential reason for the observed differences in time."
  </p>
  <p>
    The authors of <cite>Gao2017</cite> took a different approach
    to tackle the same underlying question. They look at bugs in production JavaScript systems,
    then went back and added type annotations to the buggy code to see whether
    static typing would have caught the error.
    The answer was "yes" in 15% of cases,
    which is either high or low depending on your perspective.
    Their experiment doesn't tell us whether static typing is cost-effective
    (e.g., whether any extra time taken to declare types
    would find more bugs if it was spent writing unit tests),
    but it's still a very useful answer,
    and it would be great to see this experiment repeated for another language like Python.

    <em>
      Addendum: one other interesting study of static typing is
      <cite>Fischer2015</cite>,
      which looked at whether the benefits of static typing are due to better code completion in the IDE.
      The answer appears to be "no",
      i.e.,
      whatever effect static typing has is because of the typing itself,
      not because it helps a modern development tool do the right thing when you press the tab key.
      Teasing apart possible confounding factors like this is central to any modern research program;
      if anyone knows of an up-to-date summary of related research
      we'd be grateful for pointers.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  JavaScript is growing explosively and is now used in large mature projects
  even outside the web domain. JavaScript is also a dynamically typed language
  for which static type systems, notably Facebook's Flow and Microsoft's
  TypeScript, have been written. What benefits do these static type systems
  provide? Leveraging JavaScript project histories, we select a fixed bug and
  check out the code just prior to the fix. We manually add type annotations to
  the buggy code and test whether Flow and TypeScript report an error on the
  buggy code, thereby possibly prompting a developer to fix the bug before its
  public release. We then report the proportion of bugs on which these type
  systems reported an error. Evaluating static type systems against public bugs,
  which have survived testing and review, is conservative: it understates their
  effectiveness at detecting bugs during private development, not to mention
  their other benefits such as facilitating code search/completion and serving
  as documentation. Despite this uneven playing field, our central finding is
  that both static type systems find an important percentage of public bugs:
  both Flow 0.30 and TypeScript 2.0 successfully detect 15%!.
