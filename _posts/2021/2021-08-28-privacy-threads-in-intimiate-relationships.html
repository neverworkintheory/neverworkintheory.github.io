    All of the proceeds from my next <a href="https://stjs.tech/">two</a> <a href="https://buildtogether.tech">books</a>
    are going to support the <a href="https://www.reddoorshelter.ca/">Red Door Shelter</a> in Toronto.
    One of the first things shelters like it do
    if someone is trying to escape an abusive situation
    is replace their phone,
    because their abuser may well have installed tracking and monitoring software on it
    to keep an eye on them.
    That scenario isn't discussed in most computer security courses,
    both because hackers with nose rings make for better cinema
    and because intimiate attacks usually target individual women
    rather than threaten CEOs' annual bonuses.

    <a class="bibkey" href="/bib/#Levy2020">Levy2020</a> is a great introduction to this problem
    that I think every programmer should read.
    It talks about the types of attackers and their victims,
    common features of intimate threats,
    and implications for policy and design.
    These are necessarily high-level;
    translating them into specific features in commonly-used applications
    would be a great exercise for a class or a product team.

  <p>
    In my experience,
    it's hard to get programmers to care about privacy and security—really care,
    not just pretend to care—because at some level they know that they themselves are unlikely to be harmed.
    I don't know if building a security curriculum around countering threats like this will do better,
    but I think it's worth a try.
    Even if it doesn't make programmers care any more than they do now,
    it's still worth trying.

    you save the child because you are able to do so.
    If any further reason is required,
    then it is unlikely that any further reason will be persuasive.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  This article provides an overview of intimate threats: a class of privacy
  threats that can arise within our families, romantic partnerships, close
  friendships, and caregiving relationships. Many common assumptions about
  privacy are upended in the context of these relationships, and many otherwise
  effective protective measures fail when applied to intimate threats. Those
  closest to us know the answers to our secret questions, have access to our
  devices, and can exercise coercive power over us. We survey a range of
  intimate relationships and describe their common features. Based on these
  features, we explore implications for both technical privacy design and
  policy, and offer design recommendations for ameliorating intimate privacy
  risks.
