<p>A team of Mozilla developers ran a Reddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19x7up/we_are_the_firefox_user_experience_team_this_is/">"Ask Me Anything" on Firefox</a> two weeks ago. Several thousand comments were submitted, and Blake Winton has now sorted and classified them. It seems like it would be a useful data set for someone doing empirical software engineering research; if you'd like to have a look, please <a href="mailto:greg@mozillafoundation.org">get in touch</a>.</p>
