  This paper does many things well, and I urge you to read it,
  but it's also a prime example of the kind of frustrating abtract
  <a href="{{'/2022/05/20/a-note-on-communication.html' | relative_url}}">we complained about</a> last year;
  the figure below gives a much better idea of what the authors found.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Open source software (OSS) development offers a unique opportunity
    for students in Software Engineering to experience and participate in large-scale software development,
    however,
    the impact of such courses on students' self-efficacy and the challenges faced by students are not well understood.
    This paper aims to address this gap by analyzing data from multiple instances of OSS development courses
    at universities in different countries
    and reporting on how students' self-efficacy changed as a result of taking the course,
    as well as the barriers and challenges faced by students.
