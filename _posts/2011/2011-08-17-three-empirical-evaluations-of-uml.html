    Like a lot of people (particularly those with engineering
    backgrounds), I was very excited when UML first appeared in the
    mid-1990s. "At last," I thought, "Programmers will have something
    like blueprints and circuit diagrams to help them design
    software." I knew they'd be better than flowcharts: after all,
    they were <em>object-oriented</em>, which back then was pretty
    much a synonym for "good". But, like a lot of people, I read about
    UML more than I ever actually used it. It never seemed to help me
    analyze things the way circuit diagrams had when I was an
    undergrad, and it wasn't much use as a communication tool either:
    every diagram I drew had to be accompanied by several paragraphs
    of explanatory text, and my colleagues seemed to be able to
    understand the latter perfectly well when accompanied by a few
    freehand block-and-arrow sketches.

    But anecdotes don't prove anything—to do that, you need to
    look at many people, in many contexts, over an extended
    period. User experience designers have been doing this for years;
    one of the most hopeful developments in empirical software
    engineering is the way that people are using those techniques to
    find out where and when UML is actually useful, and, where it's
    not, why not. Three fairly recent studies of this kind are cited
    below—we look forward to many more, and to a next generation
    of software design notations based on their findings.

    The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto standard for
    object-oriented software analysis and design modeling. However,
    few empirical studies exist which investigate the costs and
    evaluate the benefits of using UML in realistic contexts. Such
    studies are needed so that the software industry can make informed
    decisions regarding the extent to which they should adopt UML in
    their development practices. This is the first controlled
    experiment that investigates the costs of maintaining and the
    benefits of using UML documentation during the maintenance and
    evolution of a real nontrivial system, using professional
    developers as subjects, working with a state-of-the-art UML tool
    during an extended period of time. The subjects in the control
    group had no UML documentation. In this experiment, the subjects
    in the UML group had, on average, a practically and statistically
    significant 54 percent increase in the functional correctness of
    changes (&rho; = 0.03) and an insignificant 7 percent overall
    improvement in design quality (&rho; = 0.22), though a much larger
    improvement was observed on the first change task (56 percent), at
    the expense of an insignificant 14 percent increase in development
    time caused by the overhead of updating the UML documentation
    (&rho; = 0.35).

    We present the results of three sets of controlled experiments
    aimed at analysing whether UML class diagrams are more
    comprehensible than ER diagrams during data models maintenance. In
    particular, we considered the support given by the two notations
    in the comprehension and interpretation of data models,
    comprehension of the change to perform to meet a change request,
    and detection of defects contained in a data model. The
    experiments involved university students with different levels of
    ability and experience. The results demonstrate that using UML
    class diagrams subjects achieved better comprehension levels. With
    regard to the support given by the two notations during
    maintenance activities the results demonstrate that the two
    notations give the same support, while in general UML class
    diagrams provide a better support with respect to ER diagrams
    during verification activities.

    The main goal of this work is to present a family of empirical
    studies that we have carried out to investigate whether the use of
    composite states may improve the understandability of UML
    statechart diagrams derived from class diagrams. Our hypotheses
    derive from conventional wisdom, which says that hierarchical
    modeling mechanisms are helpful in mastering the complexity of a
    software system. In our research, we have carried out three
    empirical studies, consisting of five experiments in total. The
    studies differed somewhat as regards the size of the UML
    statechart models, though their size and the complexity of the
    models were chosen so that they could be analyzed by the subjects
    within a limited time period. The studies also differed with
    respect to the type of subjects (students vs. professionals), the
    familiarity of the subjects with the domains of the diagrams, and
    other factors. To integrate the results obtained from each of the
    five experiments, we performed a meta-analysis study which allowed
    us to take into account the differences between studies and to
    obtain the overall effect that the use of composite states has on
    the understandability of UML statechart diagrams throughout all
    the experiments. The results obtained are not completely
    conclusive. They cast doubts on the usefulness of composite states
    for a better understanding and memorizing of UML statechart
    diagrams. Composite states seem only to be helpful for acquiring
    knowledge from the diagrams. At any rate, it should be noted that
    these results are affected by the previous experience of the
    subjects on modeling, as well as by the size and complexity of the
    UML statechart diagrams we used, so care should be taken when
    generalizing our results.
