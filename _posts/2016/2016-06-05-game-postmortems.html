  <em>
    In game development, software teams often conduct postmortems to
    reflect on what went well and what went wrong in a project.  The
    postmortems are shared publicly on gaming sites or at developer
    conferences.  In this paper, we present an analysis of 155
    postmortems published on the gaming site Gamasutra.com.  We
    identify characteristics of game development, link the
    characteristics to positive and negative experiences in the
    postmortems and distill a set of best practices and pitfalls for
    game development.

  This paper is a great example of what can be learned from careful
  application of qualitative methods.  The authors' first step was to
  categorize statements in the postmortem narratives written by
  developers; that necessarily required human judgment, but if done
  carefully, that can be as reproducible as any other kind of
  scientific work:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Initially, we started with 12 categories of common aspects of
    development.  These categories were based on the categories Ara
    Shirinian identified in his analysis of postmortem reviews.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to identify additional categories, we performed 3
    iterations of analysis and identification.  The first week, we
    each read and analyzed 3 postmortem reviews each, classifying the
    items discussed in each section into the 12 predetermined
    categories of common aspects that impact development.  While
    analyzing these reviews, we identified additional categories of
    items that went right or wrong during development, and revisited
    the reviews we had already analyzed to update the categorization
    of items. For the next two weeks we repeated this process of
    analyzing postmortems and identifying categories, analyzing 10
    postmortems each in week 2, and 15 postmortems each in week
    3. After each iteration, we discussed the additional categories we
    identified, and determined if they were viable.
  </p>
  <p>
    After our initial iterations for identifying additional
    categories, we had completed the analysis of 60 postmortem
    reviews.  We then stopped identifying new categories, and began
    analyzing postmortems at a combined rate of about 40 postmortem
    reviews per week.  After each week we reviewed what we had done to
    ensure we both had the same understanding of each category.  This
    continued until we had analyzed all the postmortem reviews.

  This isn't the whole story, though: the authors also discuss
  differences between small and large teams, between developers who
  used publishers and those who published on their own, and between
  single-platform and multi-platform games.  It would be great to see
  this paper as required reading in game design classes; it would be
  even greater if students in those classes were require to do this
  kind of analysis themselves as an assignment so that they would be
  more likely to understand it, appreciate it, and act on it.
