    Research in program comprehension has evolved considerably over the past
    decades. However, only little is known about how developers practice program
    comprehension in their daily work. This article reports on qualitative and
    quantitative research to comprehend the strategies, tools, and knowledge used
    for program comprehension. We observed 28 professional developers, focusing on
    their comprehension behavior, strategies followed, and tools used. In an online
    survey with 1,477 respondents, we analyzed the importance of certain types of
    knowledge for comprehension and where developers typically access and share this
    knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    We found that developers follow pragmatic comprehension strategies depending on
    context. They try to avoid comprehension whenever possible and often put
    themselves in the role of users by inspecting graphical interfaces. Participants
    confirmed that standards, experience, and personal communication facilitate
    comprehension. The team size, its distribution, and open-source experience
    influence their knowledge sharing and access behavior. While face-to-face
    communication is preferred for accessing knowledge, knowledge is frequently
    shared in informal comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our results reveal a gap between research and practice, as we did not observe
    any use of comprehension tools and developers seem to be unaware of them.
    Overall, our findings call for reconsidering the research agendas towards
    context-aware tool support.

  Maalej, Tiarks, Roehm and Koschke conducted an observational study
  and a survey to understand how programmers read code, generating
  twenty-eight separate findings about code comprehension as it is
  practiced in industry. Two of the findings on tool usage really
  jumped out at me:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>T1: Dedicated program comprehension tools are not used</li>
  <li>T4: Tool features for comprehension are unknown</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Programmers aren't using sophisticated program comprehension
  tools. In fact, they generally aren't even aware of the program
  comprehension functionality that exists in the IDEs they use every
  day.
</p>

<p>
  This result will likely come as little surprise to most programmers,
  but it's a reality that the software engineering research community
  needs to internalize: we aren't using the comprehension tools you
  are developing. If you don't understand why existing comprehension
  tools fail to be adopted, I doubt the next ones will meet with much
  success.
</p>

<p>
  There's a lot more in this paper, including findings about the role
  that documentation plays (or, rather, doesn't play) in
  comprehension, the absence of documented rationale in most code
  bases, and the role of communication channels on comprehension.
