    With each new developer to a software development team comes a
    greater challenge to manage the communication, coordination, and
    knowledge transfer amongst teammates. Fred Brooks discusses this
    challenge in The Mythical Man-Month by arguing that rapid team
    expansion can lead to a complex team organization structure. While
    Brooks focuses on productivity loss as the negative outcome, poor
    product quality is also a substantial concern. But if team
    expansion is unavoidable, can any quality impacts be mitigated?
    Our objective is to guide software engineering managers by
    empirically analyzing the effects of team size, expansion, and
    structure on product quality. We performed an empirical,
    longitudinal case study of a large Cisco networking product over a
    five year history. Over that time, the team underwent periods of
    no expansion, steady expansion, and accelerated expansion. Using
    team-level metrics, we quantified characteristics of team
    expansion, including team size, expansion rate, expansion
    acceleration, and modularity with respect to department
    designations. We examined statistical correlations between our
    monthly team-level metrics and monthly product-level metrics. Our
    results indicate that <strong>increased team size and linear
    growth are correlated with later periods of better product
    quality</strong>. However, <strong>periods of accelerated team
    expansion are correlated with later periods of reduced software
    quality</strong>. Furthermore, our linear regression prediction
    model based on team metrics was able to predict the product's
    post-release failure rate within a 95% prediction interval for 38
    out of 40 months. Our analysis provides insight for project
    managers into how the expansion of development teams can impact
    product quality.

    If there's one "law" of software development that practitioners
    across the board have heard of, it has to be Brooks' Law: "adding
    manpower to a late project makes it later." This paper by Meneely
    et al provides a good complement to Brooks' discussions. It
    does not concern itself with meeting deadlines, as Brooks did, but
    it explores the correlation between adding people to a team and
    the posterior quality of the software the team works on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The paper reports that adding people is correlated with a later
    increase in software quality, but adding them too quickly (that
    is, at a faster pace than in previous months) is correlated with
    a <em>decrease</em> in quality. A greater organizational
    modularity is also associated with decreased quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    I confess that I have trouble wrapping my head around the first of
    these findings. Theoretically, adding people to a project
    increases its coordination costs, which in turn should impact all
    metrics of team success negatively, including quality. And yet we
    have not only Meneely et al's findings, but also <a
    href="{{'/2011/06/27/organizational-volatility-and-its-effects-on-software.html' | relative_url}}">Mockus'
    report on organizational volatility</a> making the case that more
    newcomers are not correlated with more defects, which provides
    support to this finding. One possibility, discussed by Mockus, is
    that newcomers are assigned easy tasks, and so they can't really
    break things too dramatically or in a way that won't get caught
    internally in time. Another possibility, particularly plausible in
    the Cisco data set, is that the product has matured over time—that
    software quality would go up no matter the team size simply
    because there's less new functionality added as time goes on.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, while we get better answers for the underlying
    mechanisms in the correlation between increasing team sizes and
    software quality, the best advice seems to be: it's OK to bring
    new people to a team (with respect to quality), just don't do it
    too quickly.
