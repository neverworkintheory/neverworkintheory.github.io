  Multitasking has always been an inherent part of software
  development and is known as the primary source of interruptions due
  to task switching in software development teams.  Developing
  software involves a mix of analytical and creative work, and
  requires a significant load on brain functions, such as working
  memory and decision making.  Thus, task switching in the context of
  software development imposes a cognitive load that causes software
  developers to lose focus and concentration while working thereby
  taking a toll on productivity.  To investigate the disruptiveness of
  task switching and interruptions in software development projects,
  and to understand the reasons for and perceptions of the
  disruptiveness of task switching we used a mixed-methods approach
  including a longitudinal data analysis on 4,910 recorded tasks of 17
  professional software developers, and a survey of 132 software
  developers.  We found that, compared to task-specific factors
  (e.g. priority, level, and temporal stage), contextual factors such
  as interruption type (e.g. self/external), time of day, and task
  type and context are a more potent determinant of task switching
  disruptiveness in software development tasks.  Furthermore, while
  most survey respondents believe external interruptions are more
  disruptive than self-interruptions, the results of our retrospective
  analysis reveals otherwise.  We found that self-interruptions
  (i.e. voluntary task switchings) are more disruptive than external
  interruptions and have a negative effect on the performance of the
  interrupted tasks.  Finally, we use the results of both studies to
  provide a set of comparative vulnerability and interaction patterns
  which can be used as a mean to guide decision-making and forecasting
  the consequences of task switching in software development teams.
