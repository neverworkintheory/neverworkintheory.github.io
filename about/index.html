  People have been building complex software for over sixty years, but until
  recently, only a handful of researchers had studied how it was actually
  done. Many people had opinions—often very strong ones—but most of these were
  based on personal anecdotes or the kind of "it's obvious" reasoning that led
  Aristotle to conclude that heavy objects fall faster than light ones.

  Over the last twenty years, a growing number of researchers have been looking
  to real life for both questions and answers. Unfortunately, most people in
  industry still don't know what researchers have found out, or even what kinds
  of questions they could answer. One reason is their belief that software
  engineering research is divorced from real-world problems (an impression that
  is reinforced by how irrelevant most popular software engineering textbooks
  seem to the undergraduates who are forced to wade through them).  Another is
  that many research results are hidden behind academic paywalls, which makes
  them inaccessible to practitioners who aren't willing to gamble $40 on the
  off-chance that a paper might contain something useful.

  The aim of this blog is to be a bridge between researchers and
  practitioners. Each post highlights some useful results from studies past and
  present in the hope that this will encourage discussion of what we know, what
  we think we know that ain't actually so, why we believe some things but not
  others, and what questions should be tackled next.  In order to be reviewed, a
  paper must be available under a Creative Commons license (or something
  equivalent), must present the results of some kind of empirical study, and
  must be of potential interest to people building actual software systems.  If
  you would like to contribute a paper or a review,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.author.email}}">mail the site editor</a>.
