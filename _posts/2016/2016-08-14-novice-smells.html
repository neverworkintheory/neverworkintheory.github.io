  "Do Code Smells Hamper Novice Programming?"

    Recently, block-based programming languages like Alice, Scratch
    and Blockly have become popular tools for programming
    education. There is substantial research showing that block-based
    languages are suitable for early programming education. But can
    block-based programs be smelly too? And does that matter to
    learners?
  </p>
  <p>
    In this paper we explore the code smells metaphor in the context
    of block-based programming language Scratch. We conduct a
    controlled experiment with 61 novice Scratch programmers, in which
    we divided the novices into three groups. One third receive a
    non-smelly program, while the other groups receive a program
    suffering from the Duplication or the Long Method smell
    respectively. All subjects then perform the same comprehension
    tasks on their program, after which we measure their time and
    correctness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results of the experiment show that code smell indeed
    influence performance: subjects working on the program exhibiting
    code smells perform significantly worse, but the smells did not
    affect the time subjects needed. Investigating different types of
    tasks in more detail, we find that Long Method mainly decreases
    system understanding, while Duplication decreases the ease with
    which subjects modify Scratch programs.

  I'm a big fan of block-based programming languages,
  and an even bigger fan of testing whether things that everyone knows are actually true.
  This paper was therefore a double pleasure&mdash;triple if you count
  the care with which the different effects of long methods and code duplication were teased apart.
  If the authors made their raw data available,
  this would be an excellent paper for students to work through
  in order to learn how studies of this kind should be done.
