  <p>
    Git, aptly described by the paper as <q>a cross-platform and open-source distributed version control tool</q>, is as
    popular as it is confusing and misunderstood. At least, that is an often expressed sentiment in the
    software development community. Now, the authors attempt
    to move this lament from a meme towards a quantitatively established web of validated effects. And they do a good
    job! In a way, this study
    may be seen as a complement to <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/2016/09/30/rethinking-git.html">more
      qualitative approaches to the question of Git's usability</a>.

    Yang, Zhang, Pan, Xu, Zhou and Huang use the popular developer Q&A platform Stack Overflow as well as a survey to
    attain large
    quantities of data. Armed with that, they express the following five aims:
  <ol>
    <li>Establish how many questions (on Stack Overflow) relate to Git commands and how this changes over the years.
    </li>
    <li>Find out who is asking these questions: novices or seasoned devs?</li>
    <li>List which Git commands elicit the most questions.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, find out for which commands it is hardest to get questions answered about.</li>
    <li>Get an idea how devs approach learning Git and how they are doing.</li>
  </ol>

  To these ends, the researches use a fairly complex and well-described pipeline of statistical tools. As far as I am
  able to tell they follow best practices, including the discussion of limitations, potential pitfalls and
  irregularities in the data. Thus, the paper may serve as a positive example of eliciting answers from large data sets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us then take a peek at the findings in
    regards to the five goals described above:
  <ol>
    <li>Over 80.000 questions relate to Git commands at the time of writing. That's a lot! The percentage of Git-related
      questions on SO remains fairly stable over time, with their view count being far above that of the average question.</li>
    <li>
      Over 40% of people asking questions about Git have been on SO for over four years, suggesting this is not what we
      could call a "noob problem".
    </li>
    <li>
      The most viewed questions relate to <code>git revert</code> and <code>git reflog</code>, with <code>stash</code>,
      <code>clean</code> and <code>reset</code> being close contenders. Relatable, I would say.
    </li>
    <li>
      Threads with no <em>Accepted Answer</em> are unsurprisingly dominated by rarely used commands such as
      <code>pack-redundant</code>. When filtering for more commonly commands, threads that discuss complex scenarios
      relating to commands like <code>git submodule</code> turn out to be the least answered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Supported by a survey, the authors find that almost all devs use a self-learning approach to Git. They often
      stress
      the importance of learning Git properly, while describing themselves mostly as 'advanced beginner' or
      'competent'.
    </li>
  </ol>



  </p>
  <p>
    With these findings in mind, the authors give some recommendations to researchers, educators and devs: Firstly,
    using
    SO public data is confirmed to be a potent data source for such studies. They both encourage others to use the very
    data
    they found as well as building upon the research. Findings such as the list of most 'difficult' commands may be used
    to
    design and adapt teaching programs, whether these are university courses or self-learning curricula. I definitely
    agree that
    there is a dire need for more and better targeted Git courses - the fact that most developers teach themselves
    <em>and</em> the
    fact that understanding of Git is widely elusive shows that there is indeed room for improvement!
  </p>

  <p>Overall, I can only repeat that this paper does a very thorough job at collecting relevant data. These findings can
    be readily used to
    aid the improvement of your own development skills, the design of learning material or even Git itself. I can only
    hope more studies
    which also formulate solutions will follow.

    Git, a cross-platform and open-source distributed version control tool, provides strong support for non-linear
    development and is capable of handling everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. It has
    become an indispensable tool for millions of software developers and is the de facto standard of version control in
    software development nowadays. However, despite its widespread use, developers still frequently face difficulties
    when using various Git commands to manage projects and collaborate. To better help developers use Git, it is
    necessary to understand the issues and difficulties that they may encounter when using Git. Unfortunately, this
    problem has not yet been comprehensively studied. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct a
    large-scale study on Stack Overflow, a popular Q\&A forum for developers. We extracted and analyzed 80,370 relevant
    questions from Stack Overflow, and reported the increasing popularity of the Git command questions. By analyzing the
    questions, we identified the Git commands that are frequently asked and those that are associated with difficult
    questions on Stack Overflow to help understand the difficulties developers may encounter when using Git commands. In
    addition, we conducted a survey to understand how developers learn Git commands in practice, showing that
    self-learning is the primary learning approach. These findings provide a range of actionable implications for
    researchers, educators, and developers.
