    Context: Over the years, there has been debate about what constitutes software quality and how it should be measured. This controversy has caused uncertainty across the software engineering community, affecting levels of commitment to the many potential determinants of quality among developers. An up-to-date catalogue of software quality views could provide developers with contem- porary guidelines and templates. In fact, it is necessary to learn about views on the quality of code on frequently used online collaboration platforms (e.g., Stack Overflow), given that the quality of code snippets can affect the quality of software products developed. If quality models are unsuitable for aiding developers because they lack relevance, developers will hold relaxed or inappropriate views of software quality, thereby lacking awareness and commitment to such practices.

  <p>
    Objective: We aim to explore differences in interest in quality characteristics across research and practice. We also seek to identify quality characteristics practitioners consider important when judging code snippet quality. First, we examine the literature for quality characteristics used frequently for judging software quality, followed by the quality characteristics commonly used by researchers to study code snippet quality. Finally, we investigate quality characteristics used by practitioners to judge the quality of code snippets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Methods: We conducted two systematic literature reviews followed by semi-structured interviews of 50 practitioners to address this gap.
  </p>
  <p>
    Results: The outcomes of the semi-structured interviews revealed that most practitioners judged the quality of code snippets using five quality dimensions: Functionality, Readability, Efficiency, Security and Reliability. However, other dimensions were also considered (i.e., Reusability, Maintainability, Usability, Compatibility and Completeness). This outcome differed from how the researchers judged code snippet quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conclusion: Practitioners today mainly rely on code snippets from online code resources, and specific models or quality characteristics are emphasised based on their need to address distinct concerns (e.g., mobile vs web vs standalone applications, regular vs machine learning applications, or open vs closed source applications). Consequently, software quality models should be adapted for the domain of consideration and not seen as one-size-fits-all. This study will lead to targeted support for various clusters of the software development community.
