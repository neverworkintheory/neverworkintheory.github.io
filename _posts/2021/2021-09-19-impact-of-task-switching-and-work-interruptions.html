    <a href="{{'/2021/08/09/task-interruption-in-software-development-projects.html' | relative_url}}">Last month's review</a>
    of <cite>Abad2018</cite> proved quite popular,
    so we decided to look at another study of the effect of interruptions on programmers' productivity.
    Unsurprisingly,
    <cite>Tregubov2017</cite> found a moderately strong correlation between
    the number of projects someone is working on
    and the frequency with which they are interrupted.
    What <em>was</em> surprising was that working on more projects didn't correlate with cross-project interrupts,
    so it's possible that organizations that require people to multitask are simply more interrupt-prone.
    (Note that students are typically required to timeslice five simultaneous courses;
    given that the frequency of interruptions correlates negatively with productivity,
    it's not surprising that they often feel overwhelmed.)
    Finally,
    the authors did <em>not</em> find support for Weinberg's heuristic
    that predicts a 100% increase in multitasking overhead for every addition project,
    which means I need to take that out of my lecture notesâ€¦

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Software developers often work on multiple projects and tasks throughout a
  work day, which may affect their productivity and quality of work. Knowing how
  working on several projects at a time affects productivity can improve cost
  and schedule estimations. It also can provide additional insights for better
  work scheduling and the development process. We want to achieve a better
  productivity without losing the benefits of work interruptions and
  multitasking for developers involved in the process. To understand how the
  development process can be improved, first, we identify work interruptions
  that mostly have a negative effect on productivity, second, we need to
  quantitatively evaluate impact of multitasking (task switching, work context
  switching) and work interruptions on productivity. In this research we study
  cross-project multitasking among the developers working on multiple projects
  in an educational setting. We propose a way to evaluate the number of
  cross-project interruptions among software developers using self-reported work
  logs. This paper describes the research that found: a) software developers
  involved in two or more projects on average spend 17% of their development
  effort on cross-project interruptions, b) the amount of effort spent on
  interruptions is overestimated by the G. Weinberg's heuristic, c) the
  correlation between the number of projects and effort spent by developers on
  cross-project interruptions is relatively weak, and d) there is strong
  correlation between the number of projects and the number of interruptions
  developers reported.
