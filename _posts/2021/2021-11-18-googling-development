    Googling serves as a base to solve problems and has become 
    an inseparable part of our regular life. Developers in the 
    software industry also rely on extracting relevant information 
    from Google to maximize their efficiency. A comprehensive 
    illustration of the web-search queries from the perspective 
    of software developers is provided in <cite>Hora2021a</cite>. 
    By analyzing a total of 1.3M search queries from developers, 
    the authors found that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Almost half of the queries (54.5%) from the developer’s 
      end refer to programming languages and software technologies
    </li>
    <li>
      Queries are short and are mostly focused on searching APIs 
      and code examples that can be reused
    </li>
    <li>
      Over 80% of the queries are formed of content words comprising 
      of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs and developers possibly 
      believe that function words such as prepositions and conjunctions 
      won’t affect the search results
    </li>
    <li>
      60% of the queries have at least one other similar query
    </li>
    <li>
      Stack Overflow is the most popular source for software resources 
      followed by YouTube and W3Schools
    </li>
    <li>
      The order of the search results are likely to change due to 
      minor query change such as swapping the position of words, 
      removing a word, or using synonymous words or queries
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Studies like this can establish a proper understanding of the 
  requirements of software developers and will also highlight the 
  impact of popular search engines like Google. It should be noted 
  that even developers prefer short straightforward queries and 
  ignore function words. Optimizing the search engines to capture 
  the contents from short queries and minimizing the deviations in 
  the search results can be the focus to assist the software developers 
  in incrementing their production.

Developers often search for software resources on the web. 
In practice, instead of going directly to websites (e.g.,
Stack Overflow), they rely on search engines (e.g., Google).
Despite this being a common activity, we are not yet aware of
what developers search from the perspective of popular software
development websites and what search results are returned.
With this knowledge, we can understand real-world queries,
developers’ needs, and the query impact on the search results.
In this paper, we provide an empirical study to understand what
developers search on the web and what they find. We assess
1.3M queries to popular programming websites and we perform
thousands of queries on Google to explore search results. We
find that (i) developers’ queries typically start with keywords
(e.g., Python, Android, etc.), are short (3 words), tend to omit
functional words, and are similar among each other; (ii) minor
changes to queries do not largely affect the Google search results,
however, some cosmetic changes may have a non-negligible
impact; and (iii) search results are dominated by Stack Overflow,
but YouTube is also a relevant source nowadays. We conclude by
presenting detailed implications for researchers and developers.
