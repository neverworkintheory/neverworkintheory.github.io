We've been trying to raise awareness of actionable research results among practitioners since 2011.
People tell us it's useful (or at least entertaining) but we haven't found anyone willing to fund it:
academic societies and national research organizations think companies should be falling over themselves for the privilege of doing so,
while companies don't see what any of this esoterica has to do with them meeting next quarter's targets.
If you're going to ICSE'23 next week,
please talk to your colleagues about specific, concrete, actionable, and measurable ways to sustain this kind of translational work;
if you can't come up with any, please ask yourselves whether there's any real value in being right but not being heard.
