    Developers often use APIs to access data or web applications,
    but misuse of APIs can lead to data loss or software crashes.
    Although several API misuse detectors exist,
    most of them suffer from low precision and recall. 
    To address this,
    <cite>Sven2019</cite> proposes MUDETECT,
    an API misuse detector which builds on the strengths and addresses many of the weaknesses of previous detectors.
    It has 2X higher recall than previous detectors
    and 2.5X higher precision;
    moreover,
    it can work in cross-project settings and mines patterns across projects
    rather than from only the target project.
  </p>
  <p>
    MUDETECT begins by encoding API usages as API-Usage Graphs
    to capture properties that can separate misuses from correct usages.
    It then applies a detection algorithm to mine and identify violating patterns,
    and a ranking strategy to rank true positives in order to improve precision.
  </p>
  <p>
    MUDETECT was evaluating by comparing it four other API misuse detection tools
    (JADET, GROUMINER, TIKANGA, and DMMC)
    and out-performed them all with recall of 20.9%, and precision of 21.9% in a typical setting.
    More impressively, MUDETECT's recall and precision reached 42.2% and 33.0% in cross-project settings.
    Just as linting source code for style violations and common problems is now routine,
    this work holds out hope that checking APIs will be equally routine.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) often impose constraints
  such as call order or preconditions. API misuses, i.e., usages
  violating these constraints, may cause software crashes, data-loss,
  and vulnerabilities. Researchers developed several approaches to
  detect API misuses, typically still resulting in low recall and
  precision. In this work, we investigate ways to improve API-misuse
  detection. We design MUDetect, an API-misuse detector that builds on
  the strengths of existing detectors and tries to mitigate their
  weaknesses. MUDetect uses a new graph representation of API usages
  that captures different types of API misuses and a systematically
  designed ranking strategy that effectively improves precision.
  Evaluation shows that MUDetect identifies real-world API misuses
  with twice the recall of previous detectors and 2.5x higher
  precision. It even achieves almost 4x higher precision and recall,
  when mining patterns across projects, rather than from only the
  target project.
