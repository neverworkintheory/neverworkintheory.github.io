    Jeliot is a program animation system for teaching and learning
    elementary programming that has been developed over the past
    decade, building on the Eliot animation system developed several
    years before. Extensive pedagogical research has been done on
    various aspects of the use of Jeliot including improvements in
    learning, effects on attention, and acceptance by teachers. This
    paper surveys this research and development, and summarizes the
    experience and the lessons learned.

    Like our
    two <a href="{{'/2011/12/04/online-vs-face-to-face-pedagogical-code-reviews-an-empirical-comparison.html' | relative_url}}">previous</a>
    <a href="{{'/2011/12/02/the-fcs1-a-language-independent-assessment-of-cs1-knowledge.html' | relative_url}}">papers</a>,
    this one is about software engineering education rather than
    software engineering per se, but (a) we're unlikely to improve the
    latter until we start getting the former right, and (b) education
    research has always had a strongly empirical flavor, which people
    studying "grown up" programmers could learn a lot from. What makes
    this paper interesting for me is that it describes how a specific
    research program has evolved over more than ten years. Ideas are
    turned into tools; how people use those tools, and what impact
    they have, are studied in situ; those studies produce new
    insights, which are turned into a new generation of tools, and the
    cycle repeats. Along the way, the researchers evolve as well: they
    learn how to ask more penetrating questions, and (hopefully) how
    to iterate more rapidly. Jonathan Weiner's
    book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Love-Memory-Biologist-Behavior/dp/0679444351"><cite>Time,
    Love, Memory</cite></a> does a great job of describing this
    process at greater length in genetics; young researchers (and
    those of us who are not so young) can learn a lot about our craft
    from reading both.

    So what does this paper actually cover? It opens with an
    eight-paragraph summary of program visualization—tools and
    methods to draw pictures of the states of programs as they
    execute—followed by a brief discussion of the difference
    between <em>program</em> animation and <em>algorithm</em>
    animation. Section 3 then summarizes the evolution of their
    software testbed, while Section 4 shows readers what it looks like
    now. Sections 5-10 are the meat of the paper: what do users learn,
    and what effect does program visualization have on attention (both
    in the classroom as a whole and at the individual level), on
    teachers, and on collaboration. Section 11, an in-depth summary of
    lessons learned. In a way, it's the whole point of the paper, and
    everything that comes before it is scene-setting. I wish there
    were more summaries and retrospectives like this, since every
    shared insight can save other designers or researchers months of
    wasted effort going down blind alleys.
