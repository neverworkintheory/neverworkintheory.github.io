    <cite>Rigger2020</cite> describes one of the coolest practical innovations I've seen in a long time.
    Starting from an original query,
    they automatically generate several more complex queries,
    each of which is guaranteed to produce a disjoint subset of the original's output.
    They then compare the union of those subsets with the original query's result;
    if they differ,
    there's a bug in the database's query processor.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a concrete example,
    they use the fact that boolean conditions in SQL can produce true, false, or null.
    The result?
    "…we found 175 bugs in widely-used DBMSs such as MySQL, TiDB, SQLite, and CockroachDB,
    125 of which have been fixed.
    Notably,
    77 of these were logic bugs, while the remaining were error and crash bugs."
    I would really like to see someone replicate this work for pipelines written in the tidyverse and Pandas;
    any takers?

  Logic bugs in Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are bugs that
  cause an incorrect result for a given query, for example, by
  omitting a row that should be fetched. These bugs are critical,
  since they are likely to go unnoticed by users. We propose Query
  Partitioning, a general and effective approach for finding logic
  bugs in DBMSs. The core idea of Query Partitioning is to, starting
  from a given original query, derive multiple, more complex queries
  (called partitioning queries), each of which computes a partition of
  the result. The individual partitions are then composed to compute a
  result set that must be equivalent to the original query's result
  set. A bug in the DBMS is detected when these result sets
  differ. Our intuition is that due to the increased complexity, the
  partitioning queries are more likely to stress the DBMS and trigger
  a logic bug than the original query. As a concrete instance of a
  partitioning strategy, we propose Ternary Logic Partitioning (TLP),
  which is based on the observation that a boolean predicate p can
  either evaluate to TRUE, FALSE, or NULL. Accordingly, a query can be
  decomposed into three partitioning queries, each of which computes
  its result on rows or intermediate results for which p, NOT p, and p
  IS NULL hold. This technique is versatile, and can be used to test
  WHERE, GROUP BY, as well as HAVING clauses, aggregate functions, and
  DISTINCT queries. As part of an extensive testing campaign, we found
  175 bugs in widely-used DBMSs such as MySQL, TiDB, SQLite, and
  CockroachDB, 125 of which have been fixed. Notably, 77 of these were
  logic bugs, while the remaining were error and crash bugs. We expect
  that the effectiveness and wide applicability of Query Partitioning
  will lead to its broad adoption in practice, and the formulation of
  additional partitioning strategies.
