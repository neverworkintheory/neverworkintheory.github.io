<blockquote>
  <p>
    Reliance on third-party libraries is now commonplace in contemporary software engineering.
    Being open source in nature,
    these libraries should advocate for a world where the freedoms and opportunities of open source software
    can be enjoyed by all.
    Yet, there is a growing concern related to maintainers using their influence to make political stances
    (i.e., referred to as protestware).
    In this paper, we reflect on the impact of world politics on software ecosystems,
    especially in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine.
    We show three cases where world politics has had an impact on a software ecosystem,
    and how these incidents may result in either benign or malignant consequences.
    We further point to specific opportunities for research,
    and conclude with a research agenda with ten research questions to guide future research directions.
