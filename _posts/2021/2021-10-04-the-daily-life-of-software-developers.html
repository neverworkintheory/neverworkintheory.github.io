    <cite>Meyer2021</cite> opens by asking,
    "What is a good workday for a…developer?
    What is a typical workday?
    We seek to answer these…questions to learn how to make good days typical."
    To get those answers,
    the authors surveyed almost six thousand developers at Microsoft.
    Their respondents actually spend little time on development and dislike meetings
    (neither of which is surprising),
    but only 1.7% of respondents mentioned emails as a reason for a bad workday
    (which is).
    They also found that meetings only feel unproductive when they happen during development;
    in other phases, such as planning and release,
    they are viewed differently.

  <p>
    The most important findings,
    though,
    are how much developers care about having control over their workday,
    and that senior developers value collaboration more than junior developers.
    Given <cite>Graziotin2014</cite>'s finding that
    <a href="{{'/2014/05/01/happy-sw-devs-solve-problems-better.html' | relative_url}}">happy developers solve problems better</a>,
    maybe the ultimate conclusion is to try to enable everyone in the organization
    to do what works best for them.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  What is a good workday for a software developer? What is a typical workday? We
  seek to answer these two questions to learn how to make good days
  typical. Concretely, answering these questions will help to optimize
  development processes and select tools that increase job satisfaction and
  productivity. Our work adds to a large body of research on how software
  developers spend their time. We report the results from 5,971 responses of
  professional developers at Microsoft, who reflected about what made their
  workdays good and typical, and self-reported about how they spent their time
  on various activities at work. We developed conceptual frameworks to help
  define and characterize developer workdays from two new perspectives: good and
  typical. Our analysis confirms some findings in previous work, including the
  fact that developers actually spend little time on development and developers'
  aversion for meetings and interruptions. It also discovered new findings, such
  as that only 1.7 percent of survey responses mentioned emails as a reason for
  a bad workday, and that meetings and interruptions are only unproductive
  during development phases; during phases of planning, specification and
  release, they are common and constructive. One key finding is the importance
  of agency, developers' control over their workday and whether it goes as
  planned or is disrupted by external factors. We present actionable
  recommendations for researchers and managers to prioritize process and tool
  improvements that make good workdays typical. For instance, in light of our
  finding on the importance of agency, we recommend that, where possible,
  managers empower developers to choose their tools and tasks.
